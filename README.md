Rev.D.A.Christdoss’ Strategy on record keeping 

(Source code available)

History repeats itself. Learn from history. These are the quotes we frequently heard from understandable people. As we all know that we need history. One of my well wisher and chrsitian scholar said that nowadays there are no more christian historians who write the history of their own people and bring testimonies of their ancestry and preserve their history for their next Generation people. I don’t know how true this statement is, but I could say that writing a history is a little bit horrible. 

Last few months I have struggled with my thesis which is 70% history oriented and so on. I wondered how our forefathers were writing history documents without technology. Many records, dates, place, logic uhfff… it eats my brain. 

Luckily I found one treasure which helps me to solve all my problems. YEAH HISTORY TEACHES.

In history, there was a person who wrote more than 120 books and his unpublished materials are more than he published. His name is Late.Rev.Christdos!!!.  He wrote the entire south Tamilnadu history in his lifetime. The surprising fact is his writings are more generic and are in local language. How could a person hold all these history in his mind? How does he know everything? What is his strategy for writing and bringing more unique contents in his writing? 

There are many positives to him for his writing skill. But what exactly? If i know that i can replicate his strategy to finish up my thesis without burning.

Let me tell a story (Real Story bro!!). There is a library called Neil Research Library that holds the most important documents and records. We eventually visit the library and boost our enthusiasm about theology and history. One day we found one treasure which is Rev.Christdoss’ Handwritten notes and his personal research Ledger. When I read the note for the first time, that time itself I understood how much he strategised his way of thinking and writing.  Let me elaborate.

The Prime thing to write a history is source, but we cannot remember all the sources and incidents. Good history brings history without losing any information. The barrier of remembering is quite natural and you may ask that if we write the notes we can remember everything?!!….  Then how could we track the information?, that is probably a systematic problem. Rev.Christdoss rocks here. He used accounting and timeline techniques to track the history. If you are an accountant you know that how much ledger is important to keep tracking records. He used the book keeping strategy and modified it for history records ( He is a Clergy, he is more accountable!!) 

When I read his records, he never cared about forgetting issues. He tracks the records with some specific tags and dates. If he wants to write a specific time or place or issues he can track the records with tags and dates. Literally he used the book keeping techniques to write history. He is a clergyman who has amazing language skills. It helps him a lot to write a poetic and prose presentation of history from the sick records. 

Well, I learned a lot from his records. But can I use his strategy as it is ? Yeah but we live in the modern era buth!! So I planned to digitize his strategy to keep records digitally. So I programmed a tool which is a replica of Rev. Christdoss’ personal ledger.
